(Its two premises are contained in the\n\t    first sentence, and its conclusion comes after the conclusion indicator \"therefore\".)\n\n\t    Remember: whether are argument is valid does not depend on whether \n\t    the premises (or the conclusion) are *in fact true*. So, even though both premises of this argument\n\t    are true (and so is the conclusion!), that fact has no bearing on whether the argument is valid! Whether an\n\t    argument is valid is a question solely about the logic --- the reasoning itself ---\n\t    that connects the premises to the conclusion; an argument is valid when \n\t    we can truthfully assert one (or both) of the following \n\t    conditional statements:\n\n\t    *If* the argument's premises are *all true*, then the conclusion *must be true too*.\n\n\t    *If* the argument's premises were *all true*, then the conclusion *would have to be true too*.\n\n\t    We cannot truthfully assert these of the argument above. Of course it is true\n\t    that MA is in New England and that if Boston is in New England then it is \n\t    in the USA. But do those two things together necessarily imply that\n\t    Boston is in the USA? No! As far as the premises are concerned, Boston could\n\t    be located anywhere! (The first premise doesn't mention Boston at all, \n\t    and the second premise only says that *if* Boston is in New England...)"}, {"content": "An argument is sound if and only if...", "answer": [{"@correct": "1", "#text": "It is valid and its premises are all true."}, {"@correct": "0", "#text": "Its premises are all true and it is inductive."}, {"@correct": "0", "#text": "Its premises and its conclusion are all true."}, {"@correct": "0", "#text": "It is valid and its conclusion is true."}], "explanation": "Soundness is validity plus true premises.
